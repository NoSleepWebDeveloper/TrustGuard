                                                                                                                  How to turn on 2FA.
        In order to activate 2FA to protect your accounts from getting hijacked. 
        You must install an authenticator, while most of them cost money you can use the Microsoft authenticator for free. 
        You may install it from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-microsoft-authenticator-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a or on the app store, or via Microsoft store on computers.
        After installation open the authenticator, set biometric data, and then you may go to the 'add' button and it will prompt you to take a screenshot from the website/app you wish to authenticate/add 2fa. 
        And there you have it, you have added 2fa to your account.
